# Introduction

Graphs have become a powerful means of modelling and capturing data in real-world scenarios such as social media networks, web pages and links, and locations and routes in GPS. If you have a set of objects that are related to each other, then you can represent them using a graph.


## What is a Graph?

A graph consists of a finite set of vertices or nodes and a set of edges connecting these vertices. Two vertices are said to be adjacent if they are connected to each other by the same edge.


Some basic definitions related to graphs are given below. You can refer to Figure 1 for examples.

Order: The number of vertices in the graph
Size: The number of edges in the graph
Vertex degree: The number of edges that are incident to a vertex

- Isolated vertex: A vertex that is not connected to any other vertices in the graph



## What is this Codebase?

ZGraph is a library of APIs for constructing graph databases both.
